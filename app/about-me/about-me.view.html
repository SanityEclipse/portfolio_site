    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am long-time computer enthusiast, and enjoy technology in all of it's forms. After a five year career in law enforcement, I've decided to finally pursue my passion for tech, and embark on a journey which will assuredly open more doors and offer many opportunities. I've worn many different hats during my lifetime- musician, correctional officer, retail manager, and victim advocate, to name a few. Given this, I am hoping that my plethora of professional experience, combined with my passion for computer programming, will lead me to my next adventure.
